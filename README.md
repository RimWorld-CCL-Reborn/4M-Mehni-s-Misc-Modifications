# 4M Mehni's Misc Modifications

Adds various settings to customise your RimWorld experience.

Main features include:

## Bugfixes for vanilla issues

Cats in vanilla can't hunt due to a bug. Can you believe that?!
The game gives up on sending you manhunter packs once you reach a certain size. No more!

## Extend the time for pawns to undraft themselves

Stay where I put you!
Ever had colonists auto undraft themselves while positioning them? Not anymore.

## Change the threshold at which pawns retreat

Raiders flee at 50% by default. That's boring. Want a bigger challenge? Up the threshold or turn off fleeing entirely. Want a laid back game? Set it lower! Want randomness? Custom upper and lower retreat ranges!

## Extend the time before you get kicked out of caravan maps

Because sometimes you need more time. Changing this setting requires a restart.

## Information improvements

- Show who wants to sleep with who on beds.
- [XND] Display yield info on plants.
- Supress news of chicken #357 dying.
- Confirmation before embarking if currently viewed colonist is not one you selected (AKA "I noticed you rolled fifty colonists on a naked brutality start but the one you just rolled isn't the one you're about the start the game with. Are you suuuuure?").

## Various (AI) tweaks and settings

- Don't roll pacifists.
- Don't smelt rockets by default, or destroy orbital weapons by default.
- [XND] Set a custom filth rate for humans.
- [XND] Don't interact with animals just before their naptime.

## Mods for modders

- Remove the 6 second cooldown for uploading a mod.
- [XND] Devmode spawn tweaks. Pick the stuff and quality for the item you wish to spawn.

All settings that influence gameplay are optional and can be configured or turned off. More options are planned, leave me a comment with your ideas. I prioritise by popular and easy-to-do ;-)
